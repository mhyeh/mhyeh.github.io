We study verbal leakage cues to understand the effect of the data construction method on their significance, and examine the relationship between such cues and models&apos; validity. Result shows that data with audio statements and lie-based annotations indicate a greater number of strong verbal leakage cue categories, and shows that models trained on a dataset with more strong verbal leakage cue categories yield superior results.
