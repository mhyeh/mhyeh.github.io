Hi! My name is Min-Hsuan Yeh, and I'm a research assistant in the [Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis (NLPSA) Lab](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/) at the [Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/en/index.html), advised by [Lun-Wei Ku](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/). I do research in NLP, and my interesting topics include lie detection and visual question generation (VQG).

In my free time, I like reading, palying badminton, and photographing (with films and old cameras).
