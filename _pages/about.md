Hi! My name is Min-Hsuan (Samuel) Yeh, and I'm a Master's student studying in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst. I currently work with prof. [Philip Thomas](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~pthomas/) on [Seldonian ML](https://seldonian.cs.umass.edu/Tutorials/), a toolkit for Fair ML. Before that, I was a research assistant in the Natural Language Processing and Sentiment Analysis [(NLPSA)](https://academiasinicanlplab.github.io/) Lab advised by prof. [Lun-Wei Ku](https://homepage.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/lwku/vita_en.html). I did research in NLP, and focused on lie detection and visual question generation (VQG).

In my free time, I love to read, play badminton, and take photos (film photography).
