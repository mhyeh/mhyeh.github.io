2021-11-07	Lying Through One’s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues	EMNLP	We study verbal leakage cues to understand the effect of the data construction method on their significance, and examine the relationship between such cues and models' validity. Result shows that data with audio statements and lie-based annotations indicate a greater number of strong verbal leakage cue categories, and shows that models trained on a dataset with more strong verbal leakage cue categories yield superior results.
