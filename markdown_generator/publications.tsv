2021-11-07	Lying Through One’s Teeth: A Study on Verbal Leakage Cues	EMNLP	We study verbal leakage cues to understand the effect of the data construction method on their significance, and examine the relationship between such cues and models' validity. Result shows that data with audio statements and lie-based annotations indicate a greater number of strong verbal leakage cue categories, and shows that models trained on a dataset with more strong verbal leakage cue categories yield superior results.

2022-12-07	Multi-VQG: Generating Engaging Questions for Multiple Images	EMNLP	We propose a new task, Multi-VQG, which aims to generate engaging questions for multiple images. We introduce a new dataset, MVQG, which contains arround 30,000 question and image sequence pairs. We also propose both end-to-end and dual-staged models extended from VL-T5 to generate questions with story information. We evaluate our models on MVQG and show that models with explicit story information yield better results.	Min-Hsuan Yeh, Vicent Chen, Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Haung, and Lun-Wei Ku. (2022).
